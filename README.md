# ReverseGecoding 
1. In this program, we use the geocoding concept but in a reverse process.
2. I previously uploaded a program called decoding, in that program, we take any particular address enter it, and obtain the longitude and latitude of the address.
3. In this program, we will use the same process but it will be reversed. For geocoding, I primarily use Geoapify. It's a free tool with a credit limit and requires an API key for access to communicate to the application from whom we are fetching the data.
5. After obtaining the longitude and latitude from simple geocoding, we use these coordinates to get more data such as the address, state, county, timezone, country, and other geographical data.
6. A person can modify this code according to his own needs.
7. I hope you all enjoy the program and feel free to use it as you wish.
